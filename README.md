# _Responsive Design Website_

#### Week 2 Independent Project - CSS

#### By **Rose Sponseller, Friday June 2, 2017**

## Description

The objective of the assignment was to create the Latest trends and stories from Think With Google, [shown here](https://github.com/avocadobravado/css-week02/blob/master/img/google.png?raw=true). I re-created the layout of from the Google site using the Materialize.css framework, and once I was finished I built an ice cream-themed site around it. The site is responsive and has various breakpoints depending on the size of the viewport.
